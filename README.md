## üòÆ Highlights

### üî• Generation-Reconstruction cycle for the unified diffusion process
-  The pre-trained 2D diffusion model trained on billions of web images can generate high-quality texture.
-  The reconstruction model can ensure consistency across multi-views.
-  We cyclically utilizes a 2D diffusion-based generation module and a feed-forward 3D reconstruction module during the multi-step diffusion process.
